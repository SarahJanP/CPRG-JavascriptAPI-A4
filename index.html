    <title>Tell a Joke!</title>
</head>

<!--When the user first visits the page, a random joke from the Any category should be loaded with the title "Joke Of The Day" at the top of the 
page.  When the user clicks one of the category buttons, a random joke from that category should be displayed and the title of the page should 
change to "A Random Category Joke" (replace category with the name of that Category).  The exception is for a Pun, when the title should just say 
"A Random Pun" There are two types of jokes that this API delivers. Single-part jokes with just a joke and two-part jokes with a setup and delivery.

For any two part joke, your interface should add "..." between the two parts.
Your website should follow all the best practices for valid and semantic HTML, and use well written, efficient JavaScript code. 
No CSS is required for this assignment. 
There are no additional marks for doing so, but if you want to take it further, try incorporating some of the modern web design features we've 
explored into your webpage.-->
